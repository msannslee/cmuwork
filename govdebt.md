## Highlighted Countries

I wanted to zoom in on US, UK, Canada, Germany and Japan because they have high influence in the world. I wanted to also highlight India and China but the data wasnt available. The data was manipulated to show countries on the y-axis for a better comparison over time. The x-axis shows the years and I thought it was redundant to use the label the axis with the word year. Instead of including a legend, I incorpated the name of the countries on the lines themselves. I chose to highlight US in a dark color, and use faint colors for the other countries. I wanted to use all grey but then the data would be lost. I lightened the grid lines and I wanted to make them more spread out but I couldnt figure that out.
