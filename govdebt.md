I wanted to zoom in on US, UK, Canada, Germany and Japan because they have high influence in the world. Also, there are to many countries and they data can be seen above and below. I wanted to also include India and China but the data wasnt available. The data was manipulated to show countries on the y-axis for a better comparison over time. The x-axis shows the years and I thought it was redundant to use the label the axis with the word year. Instead of including a legend, I incorporated the name of the countries on the lines themselves. I chose to highlight US ((I didnt know how to bold the US more) while using same faint color scheme for the other countries,with the exception of CAN to grey since red and pink are the similar.  I wanted to use all grey but then the data would be lost. I lightened the grid lines on the y axis, starting with 40 since none of them were below that percentage. I also didnt know how to move the label to be flush.
