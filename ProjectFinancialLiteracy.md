# Project Financial Literacy

## Outline
My project will be focused on the wealth gap between black people and white people. 
    1.     Grab the user's attention with a stark graph that insights anger.
    2.     Briefly explain why, focusing on a few elements of the broken system.
    3.     Instill hope by giving a financial literacy overview on how to build capital.



## Method and Medium
The project will be completed using a mix between video sequencing, scrolling and clickable links. <ins>Frame 1</ins> starts with a catchy bolded title "Black People are disgustingly poor", the starking graph will slide in a video sequencing style and the user asked to click to learn more. **Frame 2** is a scrollable page that explains the broken system using pictures to speak the thousands of words; after scrolling the user will be asked to click a link. **Frame 3** will be another slide show video sequence that transitions from despair to hope; once the video completed the user will be asked to click a link. **Frame 4** is cyclical process image explaining how to gain capital; the user clicks each step in the process that highlights a definition using black vs white charts and graphs; the idea is the charts will insight the user to want to learn more; each step in the process is greyed out once the user has clicked the link. **Frame 5** is a "wealth of resources". Each frame will use as few words as possible instead relying on visualizations. I think this can all be done using shorthand. If not, I am open to recommendations. 



## Data Sources
#### Source Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) :
  Net Worth--this data will be used as the startling image to display the overwhelming gap between white and black networth. 
  
  Income--this data is one of the building capital process that defines credit using black vs white spending vs income. 
  
  Debt--this data is on the same step as income. The idea is to explain debt to income ratio. highlights that black people spend the most, yet earn the least.
