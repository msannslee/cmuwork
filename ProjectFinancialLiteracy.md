# Project Financial Literacy

## Outline
My project will be focused on the wealth gap between black people and white people. <br>
         1.     Grab the user's attention with a stark graph that insights anger.<br>
         2.     Briefly explain why, focusing on a few elements of the broken system.<br>

## Method and Medium
The project will be completed using a mix between video sequencing, scrolling and clickable links. Each frame will use as few words as possible instead relying on visualizations. I think this can all be done using shorthand. If not, I am open to recommendations. <br> 

 <ins>Frame 1</ins> starts with a catchy bolded title "Black People are disgustingly poor", the starking graph will slide in a video sequencing style and the user asked to click to learn more. <br> 
         
 <ins>Frame 2</ins> is a scrollable page that explains the broken system using pictures to speak the thousands of words; after scrolling the user will be asked to click a link. <br> 
          
 <ins>Frame 3</ins> will be another slide show video sequence that transitions from despair to hope; once the video completed the user will be asked to click a link. <br>  
  
 <ins>Frame 4</ins> is cyclical process image explaining how to gain capital; the user clicks each step in the process that highlights a definition using black vs white charts and graphs; the idea is the charts will insight the user to want to learn more; each step in the process is greyed out once the user has clicked the link. <br>
                
 <ins>Frame 5</ins> is a "wealth of resources".

## Data Sources
#### [Source Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF)](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/scf/dataviz/scf/chart/#range:1989,2019;series:Before_Tax_Income;demographic:all;population:all;units:median) : 
   <ins>Net Worth</ins>--this data will be used as the startling image to display the overwhelming gap between white and black networth. 
  
   <ins>Income</ins>--this data is one of the building capital process that defines credit using black vs white spending vs income. 
  
   <ins>Debt</ins>--this data is on the same step as income. The idea is to explain debt to income ratio. highlights that black people spend the most, yet earn the least. 
   
   <ins>Investment by type</ins>--black vs white investments to bring it home why collateral is important to invest and how investing grows your cash flow.
   
   <ins>business cash</ins>--black vs white either businesses owned or business loan rates. Again to explain collateral.
  
#### [Census Current Population Survey (CPS)](https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/time-series/demo/cps/cps-asec.2019.html) : 
  <ins>Education attained</ins>--Increase cash by investing more in education. Showing the difference in education level will explain  the difference in liquidity. (capital building)
  
 
<br>
***SOURCES NEEDED:***<br>
  <ins>Resources</ins>--because this isnt a full course but instead meant to pique curiosity.

## User Interviews

For the interviews, I first asked for feedback on a school project and sent a link to the visual story. Without mentioning what the project is about, I listened and recorded each persons reaction. Next, I asked what is the story trying to tell. Then we walked though each panel discussing the flow and wording for the story. Next we focused on the data visualizations and how they could be improved. I interviewed people that I know personally. All of which live or have lived in a low income community. For privacy purposed, no information about the people will not be revealed. 

#### Interview 1

![](Interview 1.jpeg)
Planned changes: In the assets by type, I will include student loan debt. I also added a section that compares black education rates to white education rates. This is included to emphasize that many black people are educated with student loan debt, but still unaware of how finance and wealth building works. 

#### Interview 2

![](Interview 2A.jpeg)
![](Interview 2B.jpeg)
Planned chages: In the education ection, emphasize more on the inventions by mentioning how black people dont get any credit. Added a speedometer to represent commutes to work. Changed the photos in the hazardous neighborhood section to be clearer as well as mentioning long term health effects. "My community has been killing me?" I will add instructions on the scroll bar section as well as include the word submit on the button. I will also change the answers to be a different color than the guesses. I will also include the year and distinguish between US or Worldwide. Another thought is to include total of businesses, banks and billionares. But I think the point is clear. At the end, have a question or some way to close. I used a question "Whatcha gonna do about it" May be too informal. I will change the pie charts to compare side by side black v white graduation dates. Add a title and make the percentages bold and hard to miss. Include images for black inventions. 


#### Interview 3

![](Interview 3A.jpeg)
![](Interview 3B.jpeg)
Planned changes: I canged the wording around to focus more on the choices made by people living in poverty. The idea is to help people understand short minded frivolous spending vs thinking for the long run. Instead of including prison percentages, stuck with wording that people stay with the status quo and often times end up in prison because of the company they keep. Potential to include some data about black wall street. Just not sure how to incorporate it yet. I included the quote directly "Black people have to commute more than any race" No need for a statistic. Tried to include information about dumping in black neighborhoods. Changed the wording from I am educated to I am no less educated. Will use icons to represent black inventions. The an overlay staying "many inventions but no patents". Use the word asset instead of collateral since some people wont know the definition. Asset by type will include mortgages, student loan debt, credit cards. 

#### Interview 4

![](Interview 4.jpeg)
Planned changes: Rethink the assets by type graph. Include by household and year and title and legend for every graph to understand context. Consider having a stronger outcome/call to action.
