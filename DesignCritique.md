##### Critique 1
   I think this is a graph that is showing disparities between white and black wealth. I believe it’s telling me that blacks hold a very small amount t of wealth compared to whites. Probably the general public. The lines there are a bit confusing. I’m assuming you’re trying to zoom out?   to show what it means? May be better to just have one representation of this data instead of two.
##### Critique 2
   Maybe put the grey bar first and then purple. Bc right now it looks like my attn is trying to connect the purple dot to the grey bar. 
##### Critique 3
   So I can tell that the purple graph element and the pruple dot are supposed to represnt the average financial assets of a black households (I'm assuming) relative to the average financial assets to white households. But I am struggling to understand why its both as supposed to one or the other. As far as content, I imagine that the intended audience is anybody doing anything related to financial inequality or generational wealth differences and policy. Things I would change or do differently: if there is no separate function to having the circles, I'd pick one or the other. Adding a blurb to give context to the racial wealth disparities specifically highlighting that its disparities in assets. Give context around why the speculation is for assets because assets is disticnt and usually the focus is on income.

 I will be using this chart in my final project. Therefore the context will be given then. I plan to change the font for more impact, but I need help deciding. The background is black and text is white as a theme throughout the project. Therefore I chose a light grey to represent white people and a rich purple to represent black people. I am intentionally only comparing white v black for a stark contrast and to envoke a shock or anger when people see the chart. One critique mentioned adding a blurb, but instead I changed to title to infuriate people and included a small blurb near the source. I was sure to say that the image is drawn to scale. I used the Visualizing Health tool to gather ideas for how to show drastic comparisons and this is why I decided on the circles. The original circles had a spotlight which I tried to recreate but as mentioned in the critique, the two charts and the lines were confusing. So I dropped them, instead playing with color. Since the visual is drawn to scale, the circle in a circle looked like either a nipple or an eye. I chose to have the visual look like an eye that is pointed towards the numbers. The title is meant to grab attaention. However, the numbers are larger than the title becuase that is where I want the readers eyes to look after seeing this eye.
